		<baseDescription>While most of the slaves found on Vvardenfell were either Argonian or Khajiit, some were Dunmer, and [PAWN_nameDef] was one of them. [PAWN_pronoun] spent many years being forced to mine ebony against [PAWN_possessive] will.\n\n. The slave masters were greedy, and forced the slaves to dig too deep. Enraged by the blight, and the sudden intrusion into their nest, the kwama swarmed slaves and slave masters alike. [PAWN_nameDef] only narrowly escaped with [PAWN_possessive] life.</baseDescription>
