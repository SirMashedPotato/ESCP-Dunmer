		<baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] had always longed for one particular thing, potatoes, which proved somewhat difficult to obtain in Vvardenfell. [PAWN_pronoun] just wanted to feel them crumble beneath [PAWN_possessive] fists, to hear them cry out in pain as their life was extinguished, to smell their essence leave their shapeless forms. Sadly, ash yams would have to do.</baseDesc>

		<baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] was one of the many brave Dunmer who fought in the Arnesian War. [PAWN_pronoun] was one of many who heroically stormed Black Marsh. And one of the few left standing in land now belonging to Morrowind. In later days, [PAWN_nameDef] took up gardening, but is still surprisingly quick on [PAWN_possessive] feet.</baseDesc>
